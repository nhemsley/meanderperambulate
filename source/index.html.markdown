  When not enjoying the fruits of my home town, I like to tinker with web technologies. Always I am looking at the state of the art in software development, perusing various tech blogs & [news](http://news.ycombinator.com)  [sites](http://lambda-the-ultimate.org)
  to keep my finger on the pulse (it's actually an interest of mine!) of what is new & which software design methodologies people are liking at the moment.

  This is just a start, written in
  [Middleman](http://middlemanapp.com). Hopefully I will get more
  fleshed out soo, but until then, you may just want to look at my [resume](/resume.html).


Also, here is my [Github](http://github.com/nhemsley/github) profile.
